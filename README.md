# GameKernel
A fully modular kernel for text based games. 

The general idea:
text games are fairly simple, thats why they are perfect to test out consepts.
however, some concepts require a whole lot of game behind them, so the ambition with this project is to provide a workable enviroment
to develop modules that would add any game functionality and hence allow for rapid development of ideas.
